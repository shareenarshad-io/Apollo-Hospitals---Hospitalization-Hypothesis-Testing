# Apollo-Hospitals---Hospitalization-Hypothesis-Testing
Apollo Hospitals Data Science Project

As a data scientist working at Apollo, the ultimate goal is to tease out meaningful and actionable insights from Patient-level collected data. You can help Apollo hospitals to be more efficient, influence diagnostic and treatment processes, and to map the spread of a pandemic.

One of the best examples of data scientists making a meaningful difference at a global level is in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, where they have improved information collection, provided ongoing and accurate estimates of infection spread and health system demand, and assessed the effectiveness of government policies.

The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the reason for hospitalization for different regions;
How well some variables like viral load, smoking, and severity level describe the hospitalization charges;

This project aims to answer the above questions.
